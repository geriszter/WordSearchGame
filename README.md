# Wordsearch Application 
C# console application that implements a word search. A word search puzzle consists of letters arranged in a grid, some of which form words. The player 
solves the puzzle by finding all these (hidden) words which can be displayed in any direction.

The solution includes seven wordsearch files. Be aware that some 
are provided as test files that your program should reject for various reasons â€“ being in the wrong 
format for example. The program should be able to load any file that is in the correct format. If the 
program attempts to load a file in the incorrect format it should display an error message and give 
the user the option to load another file or use the default file.
